### Build, dev, and production serving

- Dev server: [server/dev-server.ts](mdc:server/dev-server.ts) creates a Vite dev server (middleware mode) and mounts it
  on Fastify with `@fastify/middie`. It dynamically imports the SSR entry for each request.
- Production server: [server/prod-server.ts](mdc:server/prod-server.ts) serves `dist/client` and renders HTML via
  `dist/ssr/entry-server.js`. It reads the Vite manifest to inject the built client entry and CSS.
- Vite environments: configured in [vite.config.ts](mdc:vite.config.ts) with `client` and `ssr` builds and a coordinated
  `builder.buildApp` hook.

Commands (pnpm):

- `pnpm dev --open` – development server with HMR.
- `pnpm build` – build client and SSR artifacts to `dist/`.
- `pnpm preview` – run the production Fastify server over the built output.

Notes:

- Do not hardcode asset filenames in prod; always resolve via the manifest as done in `server/prod-server.ts`.
- When editing SSR/dev server behavior, avoid caching `vite.environments.ssr`; fetch it fresh on each request.
